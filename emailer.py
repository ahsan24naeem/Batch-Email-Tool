    Main script execution for sending emails to a list of recipients.

    Steps:
        1. Validate the sender email address.
        2. Check for the existence of required files (recipients, CC list, subject, body, log).
        3. Read and validate the subject and body content.
        4. Read and validate the CC list.
        5. Create an SMTP server object for sending emails.
        6. Loop through the recipient list and send emails.
        7. Log the status of each email (success, error, or invalid recipient).
        8. Close the SMTP server connection.
